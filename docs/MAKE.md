# Make

[Makefile](../Makefile) provides commands for managing multiple container provisionings.

*Note:* Pass `DOCKER_USER=<user>` to set the user for run commands. Default `www-data`.

```sh
make <command> <VERSION=4.0 PHP=8.1 DOCKER_USER=www-data ... >
```

Default values:

* DOCKER_USER=www-data
* PHP=8.1
* TARGET=dev
* VERSION=4.0

## Production

ðŸ’¡ It requires a [Chevereto license](https://chevereto.com/pricing) key.

* To build a production instance:

```sh
make prod
```

## Demo

ðŸ’¡ It requires a [Chevereto license](https://chevereto.com/pricing) key.

* To build a demo instance:

```sh
make demo
```

## Dev

A dev instance is used when you have a Chevereto project in your system (`SOURCE` argument). A Chevereto project is any folder containing Chevereto code, including your own modified versions.

ðŸ’¡ It requires a Chevereto project.

* To build a dev instance:

```sh
make dev SOURCE=~/git/chevereto/v4
```

* To implement demo on dev:

```sh
make dev--demo
```

* To run composer `update` on dev:

```sh
make dev--composer run=update
```

* To run composer `install` on dev:

```sh
make dev--composer run=install
```

* To run `sync` script on dev instance:

ðŸ’¡ It syncs your `SOURCE` with the code running in the container.

```sh
make dev--sh run=sync
```

* To run `observe` script on dev instance:

ðŸ’¡ Same as sync, but observe `SOURCE` for auto re-sync.

```sh
make dev--sh run=observe
```

## General commands

Available options:

* TARGET=dev (dev, demo, prod)

## Troubleshooting

### Container never stars

**Problem**: If you get the following loop:

```plain
[* starting] Waiting for chevereto4.0-prod-php8.1...
[* unhealthy] Waiting for chevereto4.0-prod-php8.1...
[* starting] Waiting for chevereto4.0-prod-php8.1...
.
.
.
```

**Possible cause**: Wrong license key provided.

**Workaround**: Make sure to use `cmd + v` when using macOS, and `shift + ctrl + v` if using Linux to paste the license key.
