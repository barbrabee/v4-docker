# Reference

The `./bootstrap.sh` script is executed on container run and it contains logic that detects the container status (stopped or new), it provides Chevereto application code using the [Installer](https://github.com/chevereto/installer) on first-run.

The containers are intend to be used in systems where once the container gets created, it is then either stopped or started (not removed).

For disposable container-based provisioning (application provided at image layer) check our [chevereto/container-builder](https://github.com/chevereto/container-builder) repository.
