# Dev

## Quick start

* Clone [chevereto/docker](https://github.com/chevereto/docker)
  * Use `3.20` branch `git switch 3.20`
* Clone [chevereto/v3](https://github.com/chevereto/v3)
  * Your clone path will be your `SOURCE`
* Run [docker-compose up](#up)
* [Sync code](#sync-code)
* [Install dependencies](#dependencies)

## Reference

* `SOURCE` is the absolute path to the cloned chevereto project
* You need to replace `SOURCE=~/git/chevereto/v3` with your own path
* `SOURCE` will be mounted at `/var/www/chevereto/` inside the container
* Chevereto will be available at [localhost:8930](http://localhost:8930)

âœ¨ This dev setup mounts `SOURCE` to provide the application files to the container. We provide a sync system that copies these files on-the-fly to the actual application runner for better isolation.

## docker-compose

Compose file: [httpd-php-dev.yml](../httpd-php-dev.yml)

### Up

Run this command to spawn (start) Chevereto.

```sh
SOURCE=~/git/chevereto/v3 \
docker-compose \
    -p chevereto-v3-dev \
    -f httpd-php-dev.yml \
    up -d
```

### Stop

Run this command to stop Chevereto.

```sh
SOURCE=~/git/chevereto/v3 \
docker-compose \
    -p chevereto-v3-dev \
    -f httpd-php-dev.yml \
    stop
```

### Down (uninstall)

Run this command to down Chevereto (stop containers, remove networks and volumes created by it).

```sh
SOURCE=~/git/chevereto/v3 \
docker-compose \
    -p chevereto-v3-dev \
    -f httpd-php-dev.yml \
    down --volumes
```

## Sync code

Run this command to sync the application code with your working project.

```sh
docker exec -it \
    chevereto-v3-dev_bootstrap \
    bash /var/www/sync.sh
```

This system will observe for changes in your working project filesystem and it will automatically sync the files inside the container.

**Note:** This command must keep running to provide the sync functionality. You should close it once you stop working with the source.

## Dependencies

We use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage dependencies.

Run this command to provide the vendor dependencies.

```sh
docker exec --user www-data -it \
    chevereto-v3-dev_bootstrap \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

## Logs

Run this command to retrieve and follow the error logs.

```sh
docker logs chevereto-v3-dev_bootstrap -f 1>/dev/null
```

Run this command to retrieve and follow the access logs.

```sh
docker logs chevereto-v3-dev_bootstrap -f 2>/dev/null
```

## Running Chevereto commands

Chevereto application commands must run under `www-data` user.

Run the command below to execute `-C` CLI commands.

```sh
docker exec --user www-data -it \
    chevereto-v3-dev_bootstrap \
    php cli.php -C cron
```
